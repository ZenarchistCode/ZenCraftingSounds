What Is This?

This mod adds 20+ new crafting and action sounds to the game.

In a recent DayZ update the devs added a new can opening sound when opening beans and other canned foods, so I hijacked that new feature to add a bunch of new recipe sounds.

Watch the YouTube video attached to this workshop publication to see a few examples.

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be installed on both the server & client.

Credits:

All of these sounds are free-to-use creative commons sounds that require no attribution, and a couple I recorded myself. I had to listen to an ungodly amount of ASMR sound videos to get most of these effects. I will never be the same again.

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io

Enjoy!
